# 📣 Calling out to artists and creatives in the SE community ✨

You execute code to generate visuals or sound, you use creative coding for teaching or research, you build new tools and abstractions for artists, you explore esoteric languages for poetry and weird computation: we'd love to meet and hear from you !
