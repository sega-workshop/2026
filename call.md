# 📣 Calling out to artists and creatives in the SE community ✨

You execute code to generate visuals or sound, you use creative coding for teaching or research, you build new tools and abstractions for artists, you explore esoteric languages for poetry and weird computation: we'd love to meet and hear from you !

With SEGA, the first workshop on software engineering and generative arts, we aim at offering everyone who operates at the fringe of software and art an open forum to share, discuss and perform. Please, reach out with a demo,  presentation or performance idea! We welcome submissions of one page within the [Arsclassica Article Latex template](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/arsclassica-article).

As a source of inspiration rather than a closed list of topics, let us suggest some ideas of topics that we'd love to discuss with you: 

# Generative Artworks / Software Technologies for the Arts

* Nature-inspired and/or algorithmically-created artworks
* Interactive pieces
* Creative coding demonstrations or new technologies
* Procedurally-generated music/video
* Open source software and hardware for the arts
* Creative coding for software engineering education
* Technology for live coding
* Technology for generative visuals 
* Web3 technology for the arts 
* Programming languages for the arts
* Visual programming for the art
* Programming libraries and APIs for the arts
* Browser-based technology for audiovisual arts
* Middleware for the arts
* Technological sustainability of software technology for arts. 
* Empirical study of software practices for the arts

# Software Engineering Projects

* Code analysis for art maintenance and understanding
* Maintenance of art-related code
* Reverse engineering art-related code
* Binary analysis of art-related code
* Emulation for art-related code
* Transpiling art-related code
* Documenting art-related code
* Case studies of software-based art preservation
* Capture and replay for software-based artworks

Note that our on-site equipment will be limited to a projector screen, so if you require any specialized hardware we'd suggest either recording a demo video or bringing what is necessary!

The proceedings will be published as an open-source web zine and will be hosted on our GitHub repository.
